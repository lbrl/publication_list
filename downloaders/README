Downloaders for Scopus, Web of Science, ELibrary (РИНЦ).
(Downloader for Google Scholar is partially implemented but there are some complications, so better to get citation data manually for that case)

They save data to either TXT or CSV files, this can be changed fairly easily.

To adjust them for your use-case, just edit corresponding ID to your author ID
(at the start of the script)

The scripts require selenium, install it with pip (`pip install selenium` or `pip install --user selenium`)
or use the attached `00_download_selenium.sh` script to put the module in a local directory.
(it will also download geckodriver to use automated firefox)
